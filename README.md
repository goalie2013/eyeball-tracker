# Eyeball Tracker

This exercise is a practice in CSS styling and dynamic styling in JavaScript, as well as using Events.

Using an EventListener, the eyes will follow the user's mouse in realtime.

For an added bonus, the user can change the color of the eyeball's if they desire.

Additionally, I added:
- Google Fonts
- Randomized Colors
- Flexbox
- Media Queries

## Roadmap of future improvements
Project does not work well for mobile phones.
Need to change Event Listener to something that follows the user's dragging finger.
